Per Bill's approval, we would like to investigate this further and standardize a location that works for all enclosed units, regardless of control panel and engine. The suggested location is to put the manual holders on the door by the control panel on all enclosed units (see attached picture). This would affect PPC-FL-ENCL-DR2-14 and PPC-FL-ENCL-DR2-14-F (foam). Holes would need to be added to the door as well as the foam in order to mount the manual holder. This needs to be discussed at the next engineering meeting (4/10) so this can be taken care of. All affected BOMs will need to be updated with manual holder and decals if standard location is approved.

PPP-2927B-WELDED is now in very short supply because this seems to happen regularly. I will be creating a document/procedure to notify assembly the correct procedure when things are missing from the BOM. Additionally, assembly already had 2927B-WELDED installed on SO 4141 by the time I walked out there to check.\n\nImmediate resolution: Keep them installed because rework would be far more expensive than purchasing more. Dean is working on getting more of those plates ordered to fix the extreme shortage and will keep me posted. \n\nPermanent resolution: Zach added a BOM check to always include PPP-2927B-WELDED if PPP-2927 is on BOM. I will go into all active upcoming jobs and manually check if PPP-2927B-WELDED is included where it's supposed to be. I will give Zach a list of BOMs to adjust and Dean a qty to order.\n\nNext steps: Doug can we get a cycle count on PPP-2927B-WELDED for Dean?\n\n-RE 4/2/18",
